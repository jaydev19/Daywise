#Daywise
Daywise is a simple and intuitive Chrome extension that helps you manage your tasks efficiently, one day at a time. It allows you to plan your day by adding tasks, setting their status (To Do, In Progress, or Completed), and keeping track of your progress in an organized and user-friendly interface. Your tasks are automatically saved and can be accessed anytime.

Features

Drag and drop: Move tasks between different categories by simply dragging and dropping them.
Task completion: Mark tasks as complete, and they remain marked when you return to the extension later.
Responsive design: The interface adapts to various screen sizes for optimal usability.
Calendar navigation: Quickly navigate through days, weeks, and months using arrow buttons and the calendar view.
